                        <p>Anchor Handling is considered a very dangerous job to perform: you are constantly exposed to the line of fire. Tension on wires, lifted objects, big buoys on deck. All these happens while the vessel is rolling, pitching, and some times, waves are breaking on deck. <br><br>

                            <div style="max-width: 640px"><div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;"><iframe src="https://boskalis-my.sharepoint.com/personal/daniel_menendez_fernandez_boskalis_com/_layouts/15/embed.aspx?UniqueId=b4f94392-1112-4014-b391-5058b3f2ec50&embed=%7B%22ust%22%3Atrue%2C%22hv%22%3A%22CopyEmbedCode%22%7D&referrer=StreamWebApp&referrerScenario=EmbedDialog.Create" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen title="AH Video Wavejump.mp4" style="border:none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; height: 100%; max-width: 100%;"></iframe></div></div><br><br>

                            Usually vessels operate within a defined weather condition. However, our fleet operates sometimes in marginal conditions. In order to operate, special procedures take place: a job hazard analysis, special toolbox meetings, enhanced lookout.<br><br>
                            
                            <img src="/assets/6. green water traffic light.PNG" style="padding: 30px">

                            However, an increased level of safety when operating in the aft deck of our tugs wants to be achieved, and for that, we have an idea we would like you to vote for in Wavejump innovation challenge.
                            
                            During the Wavejump Ideation Phase, Daniel Menéndez, Fleet Management Trainee in Offshore Fleet Managemet, saw an opportunity to improve this operations carried out by our fleet of AHTSs (Anchor Handling and Tug Supply Vessels) and CSVs (Construction Support Vessels).<br><br>
                            
                            Idea consisted on reading wave height while predicting vessel motion, in order to foresee when were the waves going to flash the deck. This was the idea and this is what they still have in mind. But, how would it work?<br><br>
                            
                            By means of a Radar, sea state can be read. A Motion Reference Unit, which measures vessel motions would be placed on the vessel, reading motion from the vessel. A computer program, would retrieve the data, and calculate when is it predicted for a wave to be on deck. In other words, when is it going to be safe or unsafe on deck. The system would not need to foresee more than 2 minutes as  20 seconds can be enough for a crew member to be told to look for shelter. This way, we believe that we can avoid accidents on deck caused by waves.<br><br>
                            
                            Daniel posted the idea in Wavejump and started defining it better. Soon, some colleagues from R&D and OE FM reached him out explaining that idea was great and even feasible: there was a company in Delft doing something quite similar. <br><br>
                            
                            <img src="/assets/dangerous_ah.png" style="padding: 30px">

                            Actually that was not that important, but it meant that the technology already existed. Nextocean Wavepredictor tool, is already existing, and combined with appropiate vessel model and calculations, can be applied in such a way that safety in those vessels is enhanced.
                            
                            Since then, several meetings took place, between R&D, Daniel, and OE FM experts, in order to gather expertise and define project direction.
                            
                            Right now, team is leaded by Hans Duba and Daniel Menéndez, but support from other colleagues like Ike van Giffe (R&D), Sven Snoeijs (Marine Services), Konstantinos Neanidis (ISM Compliance), Gaby Steentjes (OE Fleet Management) and Sjorz Robertz (Nautical Superintendent) was crucial to better shape direction.<br><br>
                            
                            The team has proposed to develop a tool capable to be implementable on the fleet of AHTSs in a way that can improve safety, but understanding that this too can lead to a more efficient ship operation, as operating on marginal conditions could be better defined safely.</p>
