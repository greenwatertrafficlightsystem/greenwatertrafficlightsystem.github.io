                    <div class="c-content">
                        <p>Before applying for the Boskalis Fleet Management Traineeship, I understood that I wanted a job where I can provide the support where it is required. Indeed, working on a multidisciplnary role was what resonated on my mind. <br>
                            <br>As I have discussed with my internal coach Gaby Steentjes, on some positions, a generalist can be someone that is flexible enough to commit with the project and solve issues on such different topics as may arise. In my opinion, I think this is one of the positions where a multiskilled colleague can become a key partner on the following six months for the project.<br>
                        <img src="/assets/oxagon-infgrph-en-1.jpg" style="padding: 30px">
                        <p>Being part of a project as Oxagon is somethign that can really help me widen my perspective on the projects that Boskalis performs. Also, because Oxagon is being built with the purpose of creating a hub for innovation, where  the use of technologies will stop being a disruption and being a natural evolution. and CO2 footprint would be zero. I think that developing a Boskalis like website is maybe a good example of my deep connection with new technologies, isn´t it?</p>
                            
                        
                        <p><strong>OPENNESS TO DEVELOP DIFFERENT TASKS</strong></p>
                        <p>I have a Nautical background, and, I cannot consider it a handicap but make of it my strong point. Therefore, I believe I can make of it a point during this assignment. In the Maritime Academy your a taught to deal with every kind of matter that may affect your ship, where your ship is a constanly underway project. Some of my previous working experiences as Able Seaman on a vessel crewed by small amount of colleagues taught me that I can deliver everywhere am eager to, does not matter if engine room, deck, bridge or office tasks. <br><br> As a result, I see a reasonable chance to be a good team member during this assignment.</p>
                        <p><strong>HANDS ON A PRACTICAL TRAINEESHIP<br /></strong></p>
                        <p>Another point considered in order to apply to this assignment, were the possibilities of making of the assignment a practical one.
                        During my last month in Offshore Fleet Management, I was transferred from the ISM Compliance team to the pool of TSIs, where I assisted the TSIs and Vessel Managers on the preparations for Mobilization and Repair periods of Tiamat, Southern Ocean and Northern Ocean.<br><br>
                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V_p3kl6FHDY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen style="justify-items: center;"></iframe>
                        <br><br>As I understood from the presentation, this assignment might not be based in Saudí Arabia, due to the lack of housing. Last experience as TSI, has shown me that delivering solutions for our assets on a daily basis, is something I would like to continue doing. This is something that can be developed both on site and from Papendrecht. I also see this as a chance to use the network I developed in OE FM on a Papendrecht based role but, I would obviously miss the practicalities of being on field supervising and doing the jobs needed. But again, is something I am happy to adapt too.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>INTEREST ON OPERATIONAL ASPECTS</strong></p>
                        <p>During my first assignment I had a good assignment developing research on Offshore Fleet operational issues in terms of safety. I had the chance to attend to some of our vessels for internal audits, and I even attended to two rig moves in the North Sea. However I missed a bit of experience on operational matters. I see this assignment, as a good opportunity to get this real field experience and grow from the Fleet Management perspective to a more operational profile, that could lead me to better understand and fit in a Boskalis. This is something I pointed out already to HR too, and that may lead to a better fit on this project.</p>
                        <p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
                        <p>Although housing in Saudi Arabia is still a challenge and may make of this opportunity a Papendrecht based position, I see my profile adapting to the requirements that may rise on a project like this. Does not matter where it becomes developed, the opportunities that may arise, whether on a Fleet Management or on a more operational side are more than welcome. </p>
